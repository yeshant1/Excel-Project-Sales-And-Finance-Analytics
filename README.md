##Atliq-Hardwares

This project focuses on generating insightful Sales and Finance Reports using Excel's advanced features, such as Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). 
The goal is to assist businesses in making data-driven decisions by analyzing customer performance, comparing market performance against sales targets, and preparing comprehensive Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by fiscal years, months, and markets.


#Task Performed
Import the datasets in excel and perform ETL in Power Query. Use power query for cleaning the datsets in which I deal with null values, wrong values, duplicate values and trimming extra spaces. Build the data model inside Power Pivot in which established the relationship between facts and dimensions tables. Create the date dimension table and fiscal year using power query M-Language Use Data Analysis Expression (DAX) function like SUM, DIVIDE, RELATED, CALCULATE, SUMX, DISTINCT for calculating appropriate measure and calculated columns. Learn the domain knowledge of finance and sales like Profit & Loss Statement.
